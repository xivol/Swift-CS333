###Assignment #1: Toying with Swift
Implement mechanics of the board game of your choice:
* [Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess)
* [Draughts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draughts)
* [Nard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nard_(game))
* [Rummy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rummy)
* [Durak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durak)
* [Monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game))
* [...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_board_games)

_There are hundreds of thousands of different games out there. No duplicates please._

Your program should implement basic FSM flow of the game. The result should be a playground file that prints game session log:
```
Started a new game of Snakes and Ladders
======
Alice rolls the dice
Dice roll is a 3
Alice moves to 3
Alice went up a ladder
Maria rolls the dice
Dice roll is a 5
Maria moves to 5
Alex rolls the dice
Dice roll is a 4
Alex moves to 4
Ivan rolls the dice
Dice roll is a 5
Ivan moves to 5
```
There is no need to implement complex AI, use random or greedy strategy.

You can port your game from [CS253](http://edu.mmcs.sfedu.ru/course/view.php?id=57) to Swift as this assignment.

Read the [style guide](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide) before you start.
